      "If Istanbul only conjures images of domed roofs, stone minarets and Byzantine churches, then you've never seen the city through Yener Torun's lens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether picturing vibrant tower blocks against clear skies, or delighting in small architectural details, the 35-year-old photographer depicts the Turkish metropolis as a crayon-colored playground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yener Torun's idealized vision of suburban Istanbul. Credit: Yener Torun\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've seen the historical, the ancient, the nostalgic part of the city,\" he said in a phone interview. \"Those kind of photographs are really nice -- I like them too. But right (from) the beginning I wanted to do something different.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Scouring the outskirts of the city, Torun only has one precondition when selecting buildings to capture: that they're brightly colored. He then uses clever compositions to reveal the structures' hidden geometries -- staircases creeping angularly towards entranceways, or the patterned cladding of suburban facades.\n",
      "\n",
      "A former architectural designed, Torun highlights colorful cladding and other design features. Credit: Yener Torun\n",
      "\n",
      "But the photographer, who has lived in Istanbul since 2001, is under no illusion that his portrayal is an entirely accurate one (he is open about using Photoshop to beautify the images and boost their saturated hues). Nor does he claim that the images are even representative of the neighborhoods they were taken in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tourists wouldn't go there, and I wouldn't suggest they do,\" he admitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suburbs in flux\n",
      "\n",
      "The images may present an unrealistically sunny portrait of life in the suburbs, but they also shine a rare light on neighborhoods undergoing rapid change. Istanbul's population has doubled since the early 1990s, and it is the outer city that has absorbed the bulk of this growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Torun estimates that most of the buildings in his photos are less than five years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "The photos reveal the patterns and geometries hidden among the buildings of outer Istanbul. Credit: Yener Torun\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's kind of ever-changing,\" he said of Istanbul's fringes. \"So many people are migrating to the city, so there's always demand for new housing -- and new technologies and approaches to architecture (are) also changing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But you don't see it in the (city center), because these things happen in the developing part of the city -- its the outskirts, the borders.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "His sharp eye for structural forms results from almost eight years working as an architectural designer. During his time in the industry, Torun worked primarily on residential buildings -- the very type he now posts on his Instagram account , which the images were initially made for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of Torun's images depict residential buildings. Credit: Yener Torun\n",
      "\n",
      "With their bold lines and flattened perspective, the pictures are clearly well-suited to the platform (where he has over 150,000 followers). And while Torun now sells prints and exhibits at international photography fairs, his playful images are simply designed to please.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a symptom, perhaps, of the photographer's sanguine disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your work is kind of a reflection of yourself, I guess,\" he said. \"So I'm trying to spread some positive vibes through my work. I think it's kind of part of my personality too.\"\n",

      "Jean Paul Gaultier launches new cabaret show in Paris\n",
      "2018-09-28 14:12:12+00:00\n",
      "Written by Jessica Bumpus, CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "Even incredibly successful fashion designers still have dreams. Jean Paul Gaultier, the original Parisian enfant terrible (and one-time Eurotrash presenter) was nine years old when he first had aspirations of showing his bear, Nana, all dressed up in feathers, at Folies Bergère.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some five odd decades later and that dream finally comes true as the designer launches his first fashion revue at the legendary Paris venue: a storytelling of his life titled \"Fashion Freak Show.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a vibrant dance extravaganza that takes the viewer through the Gaultier early years in school -- when his teacher tried to embarrass him for creativity over non-conformity -- to his first forays into fashion, his debut catwalk show in the 1970s, the influential London punk scene, the 1990s dance and supermodel years, right up until today.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I still love fashion'\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaultier, responsible among other things for Madonna's iconic cone corset silhouette, the enduring appeal of the Breton stripe, the sailor fashion trope that knows no bounds (even seen again on the Paris Fashion Week catwalks again this week at Chloe in knotted cord), has had quite the career.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I still love fashion, it is my life, but I was always saying I will do a revue one day and it is that day,\" said the designer backstage before the show's premiere as dancers took to the stage to stretch it out. He recalls as child: \"I loved it [Folies Bergère] so much that I think I wanted to do something like that -- the feathers, the glitter -- so I took my teddy bear and put some feathers on him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jean Paul Gaultier with his teddy bear. Credit: Laurent Seroussi\n",
      "\n",
      "That same bear makes for the subject of the opening number in a series of tinsel tributes, busting some moves in said conical corsetry -- later on there comes a London punk sex club scene, an homage to the 1990s trend for excess, botox and all, and a semi-nude finale celebrating beauty in all of its natural forms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I definitely wanted to be a couturier,\" said Gaultier, who imagined the entire spectacular as a visual tableaux, teaming up with Tonie Marshall as co-director and Nile Rogers on the music to bring it all to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think truly that fashion, some people find it frivolous and, yes, it is and it's good that it is frivolous but through fashion you can do a lot of things, show a lot of things, say a lot of things, you can pretend, you can express yourself, or you can communicate through fashion what's happening in society.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "All of which now seems especially pertinent in today's socially and politically-charged landscape. \"If you're the right designer, it's because you think, you [understand] what's happening in society and you make propositions of how society is going. I did it instinctively because I [understood] it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "1 / 7 Among the many Jean Paul Gaultier classics is the conical bra and corset, originally thought up by the designer when he didn't have a doll to play with and so created a cone bra for his teddy bear instead. Here, one of the performers from the designer's Fashion Freak Show wears one. Credit: ©TS3, Photo: Boby\n",
      "\n",
      "It's for all of these reasons that the designer has found himself working with the likes of Madonna and Boy George over the years, helping them to celebrate and define their individually iconic stage presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Of course, to work with Madonna was quite fantastic, that I cannot deny because I was also a fan and she was wearing my clothes. Madonna is incredible and at the same time she was saying something I was saying about the power of the woman, so I felt in some ways close to her about that,\" says Gaultier.\n",
      "\n",
      "©TS3, Photo: Boby\n",
      "\n",
      "Churning out ideas\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't the designer's first foray into stage and screen -- Gaultier designed the costumes for the cult sci-fi film \"The Fifth Element,\" was co-host of the irreverent television show Eurotrash long before fellow designer Michael Kors took his mercurial turn on television as co-judge of Project Runway. And he has been perpetually referenced by designers time and again, whether it be through costume, collection or the renowned male and female forms of his perfume bottles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, if you thought you had a new idea, think again: Gaultier has most likely already beaten you to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I feel proud and happy because even if it's copying it's like a reconnaissance, what I was doing before was more underground but now it is more popular so I am very happy about that,\" he acknowledges graciously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also charged with the title \"enfant terrible\", the designer however is reluctant to lay claim to that crown now but notes he is still one in spirit. \"I am 66 so you can't say enfant terrible. Now I'm more calm and quiet.\" Certainly, five hours before the curtain call of his life (this is a biography after all), Gaultier was, as final lighting decisions were being made, last rehearsals wrapping up, sequins sparkling and feathers a flutter backstage.\n",
      "\n",
      "©TS3, Photo: Boby\n",
      "\n",
      "And five decades later, Gaultier still very much has his finger on the pulse, especially given today's emphasis on equality. \"Because I was surrounded by women I was very shocked when I started out in fashion to hear for example that women were [seen as] an object -- be beautiful and shut up, even films said that.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, things that always shock me [are] when you see the man's jacket style on a woman and you see there is no pocket here [gestures to chest]. Why? The men have. Why? Because men have the wallet so it means something -- it means a woman knows she doesn't pay. I say yes women can also pay.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Some might say provocateur, others enfant terrible. Or you could simply call it modern-day thinking.\n",
