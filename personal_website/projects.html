        <h2>JeastPitch</h2>
        <h3>Yeast  Web Application</h3>
        <p>&emsp;For this project, we will be calculating yeast by creating an online yeast calculator.  Currently, there are yeast calculators available, while many have useful features, none fully encompass the need of the brewer. Brewers usually tend to error on the side of caution, buying more than they need and the rest gets wasted or buy too little, having to wait to buy more or reduce production. JeastPitch looks to alleviate this problem by doing the math for the brewers.
            <ul>
                <li>Pitch rate changes based on yeast strain.</li>
                <li>Propagation time to reach targets.</li>
                <li>Materials required for propagation.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>&emsp;This web application will allow users to better plan production around their available yeast while reducing downtime and waste taking the guesswork out of yeast management.</p>

        <h2>JeastyPy</h2>
        <h3>A computer vision application to aid in the management of yeast.</h3>
        <p>&emsp;JeastyPy derives its name sake from the german pronunciation of yeast combined with the abbreviation of python. The derivation of the name gets of at the heart of the purpose of JeastyPy, which is to address the quality and quantity yeast counting needs of micro and craft breweries. Currently there is a lack of knowledge and experience around the proper and effective use of a microscope to count yeast while also addressing its health and viability.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Currently there are two solutions to this problem. The first can prohibitively expensive for many breweries as the specialized equipment is in excess of $10,000. This selection of apparati were developed initially for the medical and research industries to identify and count cells. The second option is a professional with training and experience working with limited materials having a cost close to $500. The problem with this second option is the lack of people with these skills, knowledge, and experience as they could easily almost double their salary in a different sector of the field doing lab work.</p>
        <p>&emsp;JeastyPY is an independent venture looking to solve this problem by bridging the gap between the two solution. This is accomplished by taking the low end equipment of a microscope, hemocytometer, and methylene blue with the addition of a high resolution digital camera, so images can be captured. These images can then be processed to classify cells into alive or dead, quantify area, and vacuole area to predict viability and vitality more effectively.</p>
        <p>&emsp;As the saying goes “brewers make wort, yeast makes beer”, JesatyPy has a clearly defined purpose to solve the problem presented to brewers with yeast handling.</p>
